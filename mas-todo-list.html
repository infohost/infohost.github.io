   MAS Issues List:
   
 - Cosmetic error: Showing product name Windows 10 in Windows 11 system in HWID/KMS38 scripts.
                   Reason: Product name registry is not updated in windows 11, didn't use WMI method because changes reflects in late when edition is changed
                   Solution: Replace Windows 10 with 11 in reg query product name (to be updated in MAS v1.6)


   MAS Todo List:
   
 - Update read me's with better format and content
 - Simplify removal of Zone.Identifier in script "Verify_Files-Clear_Zone.Identifier-68.cmd"
 - Updated slc.dll for lockbox method, so that separate slc.dll is not required for ARM64
 - Test the scripts with various av's and find which commands or series of commands av's are complaining about and find alternatives
 - Do more testing and find bugs
 - More improvements in KMS script
 - Show warning to clean subscription license in KMS script when expired Office subscription license is detected. It prevents volume license to take effect in activation
 - Make HWID/KMS38 scripts futureproof for new Windows editions by getting required key from system itself
