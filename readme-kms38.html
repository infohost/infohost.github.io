   KMS38 Activation:
====================================================================================================

 - This activation method activates Windows 10 and Windows Server (14393 and later builds), 
   until the year 2038.
 - This activation method does not store any files on the system.

 - Make sure the following things have been accounted for, before applying KMS38 Activation:
   - Before the activation, if any KMS activator is installed, then make sure to uninstall it 
     completely.
   - After KMS38 activation for the Windows Operating System has been achieved, if you want to 
     additionally, use the 180 Days KMS Activator for MS Office, then you must make sure that 
     it (the 180 Days KMS Activator for MS Office) is compatible with Windows KMS38 activation. 
     FYI, the following activators are compatible and can activate Office 
     without disrupting the Windows KMS38 activation.

     Online KMS Activation Script  https://www.nsaneforums.com/topic/316668--/

 - Any KMS Activator which is not compatible with KMS38, may overwrite the KMS38 activation for 
   Windows with its own 180 days activation, thereby destroying the KMS38 activation for Windows. 
   To prevent this accidental overwriting, you can apply KMS38 protection for Windows, check 
   the Extras folder for more details.

 - Why is the script setting the specific KMS host to 127.0.0.2 (localhost)?
   - By doing this, global KMS IP can not replace KMS38 activation but can be used with Office and
     other Windows Editions.
   - In case you don't like it, you can remove it with following codes, open CMD as admin and enter,

set "SPPk=SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform"
reg delete "HKLM\%SPPk%\55c92734-d682-4d71-983e-d6ec3f16059f" /f
reg delete "HKU\S-1-5-20\%SPPk%\55c92734-d682-4d71-983e-d6ec3f16059f" /f

 - Check Troubleshoot Script in the "Extras" section if you are facing issues with activation.

 - Check Extract OEM option in the "Extras" section if you want pre-activated Windows installation.

 - Make sure to properly and completely remove any previously-installed KMS activator if one already exists.
 - Open CMD as Admin, and enter the following listed commands in the sequence in which they are given.
 - Enter Generic Volume License Key (GVLK) (Replace '%key%' with the key from the above list) 
   with the following command:
   
cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /ipk %key%

 - Set specific KMS host to 127.0.0.2 [Localhost] with the following command: (Run one by one)
   - By doing this, the global KMS IP can not replace the KMS38 activation, and can then safely be used with MS Office 
     and other Windows Editions.
   - It's optional.

set spp=SoftwareLicensingProduct
for /f "tokens=2 delims==" %G in ('"wmic path %spp% where (Description like '%%KMSCLIENT%%' and Name like 'Windows%%' and PartialProductKey is not NULL) get ID /VALUE"') do (set app=%G)
wmic path %spp% where ID='%app%' call ClearKeyManagementServiceMachine
wmic path %spp% where ID='%app%' call ClearKeyManagementServicePort
wmic path %spp% where ID='%app%' call SetKeyManagementServiceMachine MachineName="127.0.0.2"
wmic path %spp% where ID='%app%' call SetKeyManagementServicePort 1688

 - Make sure slc.dll and gatherosstate.exe files are located in the folder, "C:\Files" and enter 
   following command to generate GenuineTicket.xml file.

call "C:\Files\gatherosstate.exe"

 - Now a GenuineTicket.xml file should be created in the folder "C:\Files\", copy and paste this file in the 
   folder named, "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\ClipSVC\GenuineTicket\"

 - Now apply this ticket using the following commands in this sequence:
   (In case of server cor and acor editions, copy the clipup.exe file to the folder "C:\Windows\System32\")

net stop ClipSVC
net start ClipSVC

 - Check the expiry date of the activation with the following command: 

cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /xpr

 - If the expiry date is not in the year 2038, then enter the following command: 

cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /rearm-app 55c92734-d682-4d71-983e-d6ec3f16059f
set spp=SoftwareLicensingProduct
for /f "tokens=2 delims==" %G in ('"wmic path %spp% where (Description like '%%KMSCLIENT%%' and Name like 'Windows%%' and PartialProductKey is not NULL) get ID /VALUE"') do (set app=%G)
cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /rearm-sku %app%

 - check expiry date again, now it should show activation until the year 2038.

 - Done.

   * Note - [clipup -v -o -altto <ticket_path>] method to apply the ticket was not suggested because
            of the issues in case the username have spaces or non English characters.

   Script history:

   Based on the methods by the above mentioned original co-authors, @s1ave77 first made a batch script 
   for HWID and later switched to Autoit based tool 'hwid.kms38.gen.mk6.exe' and left the batch script.
   
   After that the script was revived and updated as 'W10 Digital License Activation Script' by me 
   (@WindowsAddict) and later merged in 'Microsoft Activation Scripts' project.
