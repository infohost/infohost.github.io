====================================================================================================
   $OEM$ Folders [Windows Pre-Activation]:
====================================================================================================

 - To create a preactivated Windows installation .iso, do the following things:
   - Extract $OEM$ folder to desktop using the script.
   - Copy the "$OEM$" folder to the "sources" folder in the Windows installation media (.iso or USB).
   - The directory will appear like this: \sources\$OEM$ in your altered .iso or on your bootable 
     USB drive.

   Now use this .iso or bootable USB drive to install Windows and it will either already be activated 
   (KMS38) as soon as it boots, or will self-activate at first internet contact.








====================================================================================================

=======================
   HWID:
=======================

 - When using Digital License (HWID), no files are stored on the system, and when connected to the 
   internet for the first time, the system will self-activate at that time.
   
   You can also use the toggle option in the script to extract HWID alternate mode (clientLockboxKey)
   instead, in that case user 'may' need to reboot system once for automatic activation.
   
=======================
   KMS38:
=======================

 - When using KMS38, no files are stored on the system, and Windows becomes activated immediately 
   without further actions or connectivity of any kind being required.
   
==================================================================
   Online KMS (separately, or in combination with HWID or KMS38):
==================================================================

 - By default it applies the following two methods. You can turn off any of them in setupcomplete.cmd file
   _________________________________________________________

   1- Automatic Renewal via Task Scheduler---

   It creates following files and tasks,

   Files:
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx64.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx86.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.txt

   Scheduled Tasks:
   \Online_KMS_Activation_Script-Renewal  (Weekly)
   \Online_KMS_Activation_Script-Run_Once (Activation Task)

   The scheduled task runs only if the system is connected to the Internet.
   Activation Task will run on the system login and after successful activation and registering 
   online KMS server, this task will delete itself. leaving behind only one task to run weekly 
   for the lifetime of the system.
   _________________________________________________________
   
   2- Manual Renewal via Desktop Context Menu---

   It creates Desktop context Menu for manual activation and renewal.
   It creates the following files and registry entries.

   Files:
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx64.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx86.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.txt
   
   Registry entries:
   HKCR\DesktopBackground\shell\Activate Windows - Office
   HKCR\DesktopBackground\shell\Activate Windows - Office\command

   It creates an easy to reach the Desktop context menu for the manual activation renewal.

 - These files are used in cleaning office license in C2R Retail office to VL conversion process.
   
 - These files are taken from the old version of Microsoft official tool 'O15CTRRemove.diagcab'.

   _________________________________________________________
   
   Important note - Some sensitive AV's may flag the Automatic Renewal via the Task, and not 
   because of KMS, because for them it's suspicious to run long scripts in the background as Tasks.

   It's recommended to set exclusions in Antivirus for
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd
   or
   Turn off Automatic Renewal via Task Scheduler in the setupcomplete.cmd file and only use 
   Manual Renewal via Desktop Context Menu.
   _________________________________________________________
   
 - When using Online KMS plus HWID Digital License, Online KMS script will be set to skip Windows 
   activation if the HWID activation was applied but was not successful due to lack of internet 
   at the time of installation of Windows, but will register the KMS for other products, and all 
   later installed Volume License (VL) products (MS Office) will self-activate when going online. 

 - When using Online KMS plus KMS38, Online KMS will not skip Windows activation but skip KMS38 
   activation and will register the KMS for other products, and all subsequently-installed Volume 
   License (VL) products (MS Office) will self-activate when going online.

====================================
   HWID (Fallback to KMS38):
====================================
  
 - In this method, KMS38 will be used for the activation in case the Windows version is not 
   supported by HWID. For example, Windows 10 LTSC and Windows server.

====================================================================================================






====================================
   Info:
====================================



- In each preactivation method, a Read_Me.txt file will be created on the desktop to let the user
  know which method was used and how it's supposed to work.
  
  You can turn it off in the setupcomplete.file
