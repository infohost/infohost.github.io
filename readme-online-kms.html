   Online KMS Activation:
====================================================================================================

 - This Online KMS Activation script,

   - is a fork of @abbodi1406's KMS_VL_ALL Script  forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/838808
     this fork's purpose is to avoid having any KMS binary files and activate Windows / Office using 
     only transparent batch script with online public KMS servers.

   - activate Windows / Office for 180 Days, for Core / ProWMC editions it is 30/45 Days. 
   - can activate both Retail and VL Windows installation.
   - can activate C2R Retail and VL Office, but not 2010/2013 MSI Retail Office. 
   - skip the activation of any permanently / KMS38 activated product.

   As mentioned, it activates only for a limited period and it's not permanent, read below on how 
   to achieve lifetime activation.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

   Activation Renewal:
_______________________________________

 - By design in the KMS activation method, the system contacts the registered server every 7 
   days, and if contacted successfully it will automatically renew and reset the activation for the 
   the full period of 180 days again, starting from the day of successful contact.
   If the system cannot contact the server, it will be deactivated after 180 days and it will 
   remain deactivated until contact can be restored.

 - The KMS servers I've added have been working steadily, but there can be no guarantee that   
   they will remain online indefinitely. In case when a registered server goes down, and you want 
   lifetime activation, you either need to create an automatic renewal task, or manually renew the 
   activation whenever required.

   There are 3 ways you can renew the KMS server and as a result, renew the activation.
_______________________________________

 1- Activation via Online KMS Script:
    Run activate option whenever the system needs activation.
_______________________________________

 2- Activation via Desktop Context Menu:

   This method is exactly same as above but here we put the following files in,
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx64.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx86.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate_dcm.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.txt

   and create registry entries in,
   HKCR\DesktopBackground\shell\Activate Windows - Office

   It creates an easy to reach Desktop context menu for the manual activation renewal.
   (*It has limited menu options, renewal setup install and uninstall options are not there)
_______________________________________

 3- Automatic KMS server Renewal via Task Scheduler:
   
   This method put the following files in,
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate_tsk.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.txt

   And creates a scheduled task (Renewal) to run the script every 7 days.
   This task register the working KMS server and trigger activation command only for the installed 
   Volume products.

   The scheduled task runs only if the system is connected to the Internet.
  
   Note - Some sensitive Anti-virus's may flag the Automatic Renewal via the Task,
   You may need to set an exclusion for the below file in your Antivirus Program.
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate_tsk.cmd
   or
   use the 1st or 2nd option for activation renewal.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

   Remarks:
_______________________________________

 - With KMS Activation, you can update Windows/Office without any issues.
 
 - This Online KMS Activation provides immediate global activation for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, which 
   means that in the following three scenarios, the system will self-activate when connected to the 
   internet, and also means that users will not need to manually run the activation script again.

   Scenario 1: Subsequent installation or alteration of any 2013, 2016, or 2019 Volume License 
               (VL) Office product.
   Scenario 2: Windows edition change (with GVLK).
   Scenario 3: Date change, system hardware change, etc.

 - What is left in the system in the activation process?
   - Activation via Online KMS Script
     After activation, it leaves only the KMS Server name in the registry, which helps you to get the
     above-mentioned global activation feature whereby the system auto-renews the activations,
     so it's a good thing if you leave the server name in the registry.
     However, you can clear this registered KMS Server name upon activation with options in script.

     What is left in the system when Renewal methods are installed, has been mentioned above.

 - This script includes the most-stable KMS servers (15) list from all over the world. The server 
   selection process is fully automatic. Script randomly select a server, tests if it's online, 
   if yes then apply the activation command, if fails, then retry this process maximum of total 
   4 times for a product. Such redundancy makes sure that we get the working KMS server any time.

 - If your system date is incorrect (beyond 180 days) and you are offline, the system will be 
   deactivated, but will automatically reactivate when you correct the system date. 

 - The advantage of Online KMS activation is that it doesn't need any KMS binary file and 
   system can be activated using some manual commands or transparent batch script files.
   So this is for those who don't like/have difficulties/trust issues in offline KMS because of its 
   binary files and antivirus detections.

   But if you prefer offline KMS then checkout an awesome open-source activator,

_______________________________________

   Activation Troubleshoot:
   Check Activation Troubleshoot option in the "Extras" section of the 'MAS' project.

_______________________________________

   Preactivation:
   For Windows preactivation at the time of Windows installation, check Extract $OEM$ Folder 
   option in the "Extras" section of the 'MAS' project.

_______________________________________

   How to undo the KMS activation for Windows? I want to activate with my own activation key.

   - Open CMD as admin and enter your activation key (non KMS key) with the below command,
     slmgr /ipk *****-*****-*****-*****-*****

   - That's all, further process is not required.

   Office Volume 2010 / 2013 / 2016 / 2019

   Office C2R Retail O365/2013/2016/2019
________________________________________________________________

   Notes:

   These editions are only KMS-activatable for 45 days at max:
   Windows 10 Home edition variants  
   Windows 8.1 Core edition variants, Pro with Media Center, Pro Student

   These editions are only KMS-activatable for 30 days at max:
   Windows 8 Core edition variants, Pro with Media Center
   
   Office C2R Retail need volume conversion, script will convert it if needed.
   
   Supported Windows products do need volume conversion, only the GVLK (KMS key) is needed, which 
   the script will install accordingly.

   KMS Activation works in all (MBR, GPT, UEFI, BIOS) systems.

====================================================================================================
   Unsupported Products:
====================================================================================================

   Office MSI Retail 2010/2013
   Office UWP (Windows 10 Apps)

   Windows Editions which do not support KMS activation by design:  
   Windows Evaluation (EVAL) Editions  
   Windows 7 (Starter, HomeBasic, HomePremium, Ultimate)  
   Windows 10 (Cloud "S", IoTEnterprise, IoTEnterpriseS, ProfessionalSingleLanguage... etc)  
   Windows Server (Server Foundation, Storage Server, Home Server 2011... etc) 

   On some OEM systems, KMS activation on Windows 7 can not work due to unqualified BIOS
   Check details here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/942962/

====================================================================================================
   Office C2R Retail to Volume conversion:
====================================================================================================

   By default, this activation script will convert Office C2R Retail to Volume.
   Office Retail must be converted to Volume first before it can be activated with KMS specifically, 
   Office Click-to-Run products, whether installed from ISO (e.g. ProPlus2019Retail.img) or 
   using Office Deployment Tool.

   Notes:

   Supported Click-to-Run products: Office 365, Office 2019, Office 2016, Office 2013
   Activated Office Retail products will be skipped from conversion
   Office 365 itself does not have volume licenses, therefore it will be converted to Office Mondo licenses
   Office Professional suite will be converted with Office ProPlus licenses
   Office HomeBusiness/HomeStudent suites will be converted with Office Standard licenses
   Office 2016 products will be converted with corresponding Office 2019 licenses
   If Office 2019 RTM licenses are not detected, Office 2016 licenses will be used instead

   On Windows 7, Office 2016/2019 licensing service require Universal C Runtime to work correctly
   UCRT is available in the latest Monthly Rollup, or the separate update KB3118401
   Additionally, Office programs themselves require recent Windows 7 updates to start properly
   
   If the automatic conversion did not work, or if you prefer to use the separate converter script:

   You can also use other tools that can convert licensing:

====================================================================================================
   Check Activation Status:
====================================================================================================

   Check the status of Windows and Office products.
_______________________________________

   Check Activation Status [vbs]:

   Query and execute official licensing VBScripts: slmgr.vbs for Windows, ospp.vbs for Office
   Office 2010 ospp.vbs shows a very little info
_______________________________________

   Check Activation Status [wmic]:

   Query and execute native WMI functions, no vbscripting involved
   It shows extra more info (SKU ID, key channel)
   It shows the activation expiration date for all products
   It shows more detailed info for Office 2010
   It can show the status of Office UWP apps

====================================================================================================
   Advanced options:
====================================================================================================

   * You can use below options either by using GUI in the script or by editing the file 
     'Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd' from 'MAS' separate files version.
_______________________________________

   Debug Mode:-

   When the activation is run with Debug Mode enabled, it creates a log file which contains full 
   details of activation process, this is useful to detect activation errors.
_______________________________________

   Clear KMS Cache:-

   By default, the KMS activation leaves KMS server address (cache) in the registry. 
   When this mode is on, it clears KMS cache after the activation.

   Registered KMS server enables the system to automatically renew the license for the next 180 days,
   every 7 days, as long as the server is online (means the activation will never expire).
   This process is the same as how the legal KMS works, so no security program will flag this 
   behaviour. It's better to leave this option as default, off.
_______________________________________

   Convert Office C2R-R2V:-

   The script is set by default to auto convert detected Office C2R Retail to Volume 
   (except activated Retail products). You can turn off this function if you prefer that.
_______________________________________

   Skip Windows 10 KMS38:-

   The script is set by default to check and skip Windows 10 activation if KMS 2038 is detected.
   However, if you want to revert to normal KMS activation, you can turn it off.
_______________________________________

   Set a KMS Server:-

   The script is set by default to check various KMS servers and select which is online.
   However, if you want to use only any specific KMS server then you can use this option.

====================================================================================================
   Command line Switches:
====================================================================================================

   * All switches applies only with the file 'Online_KMS_Activation\Activate.cmd' in 'MAS' separate
     files version.

   * Operation will be unattended if any switch is used.

   * Below the switches are divided into five parts, you can use the combination of switches from 
     only a part at a time.

___________________________________________________________
   
 - Connect to the internet. 
 - Open CMD as Admin, and enter the following listed commands in the sequence in which they are given.
 - If Office is installed as VL (Volume License) then there is no need to enter its key. 
 - If Office is installed as Retail, then you need to convert it to VL, by using C2R-R2V by @abbodi1406

 - Change to the directory where Office is installed.
   If Office is 32-bit on 32-bit Windows or 64-bit Office on 64-bit Windows use the following:
   
   For Office 2016 or 2019 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16"
   
   For Office 2013 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15"
   
   For Office 2010 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14"
   
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   If Office is 32-bit on 64-bit Windows, use the following:
   
   For Office 2016 or 2019 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16"
   
   For Office 2013 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15"
   
   For Office 2010 enter the command:
   
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14"
   
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
 - Once all of that is done correctly, now register the KMS Server, (In the following,
   replace %server% with one of the above-listed servers) (If activation is unsuccessful 
   then try a different server) with the following command:

cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:%server% 

 - Activate Office with the following command: 
   
cscript ospp.vbs /act 
   
 - Check Activation Status with the following command:
   
cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus
 
 - Clear the name of the KMS server, (Optional) (It'll prevent activation auto-renewal)
   
   Below commands can be used to completely clean the KMS activation remnants from the system,
   for both windows and office.

   Online KMS Script is a fork of @abbodi1406's KMS_VL_ALL  forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/838808

   This fork's purpose is to avoid having any KMS binary files and activate Windows/Office using 
   only transparent batch script with online public KMS servers.

   Thanks to @RPO and @abbodi1406 for providing help in making of this fork.
