====================================================================================================
   What are those big blocks of text in this script? [MAS_1.3_AIO]
====================================================================================================

   These big blocks of text contain the files required for the Activations, and Office Retail 2 VL 
   conversion.

   The file to text, and text to file, conversions are done with the script named "Compressed2TXT"
   by @AveYo aka BAU https://github.com/AveYo/Compressed2TXT

   The purpose behind doing this is straightforward. It is to make an All-in-One script, and an 
   All-in-One script can't be created without file to text conversion.
   But still if you are not feeling comfortable in using it then you can use another version I've made,

   MAS - (separate files version)

   GitHub: https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts
   GitLab: https://gitlab.com/massgrave/microsoft-activation-scripts

   When required, the script extracts the files into the "C:\Windows\Temp\_MAS" and / or 
   "C:\Windows\Temp\_Ticket_Work\" folder.
